Object Storage

Object Storage

Replit Object Storage lets you store files like images, videos, and documents
in cloud containers called **buckets**. Buckets are containers for storing
objects such as files. They include access policies to limit what actions users
or applications can perform on their contents.

The Replit Object Storage tool lets you seamlessly share data between your
development and production environments or with other Replit Apps.

## [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#features)  Features

Replit Object Storage is powered by Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
This means you receive the benefits of industry-leading uptime,
availability, and security.

Object Storage provides the following features for your Replit Apps:

- **Cloud availability**: Store files online and access them with any of your Replit Apps
- **Scalability**: Handle growing data needs without worrying about limits
- **Share buckets across apps**: Share access to buckets across Replit Apps
- **Programmatic access**: Upload, download, and manage files using intuitive APIs

Here are a few ways you can use Object Storage in your Replit Apps:

- Store media for a photo album or portfolio site
- Serve product demo videos on your landing page
- Create backups of your app log files

## [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#usage)  Usage

Your Replit App must authenticate with Google Cloud Storage to access a bucket and its objects.
Use the official Replit Object Storage client libraries to automatically authenticate.

You can access the Object Storage tool directly in your Replit App workspace.

How to access the Object Storage tool

From the left **Tool dock**:

1. Select ![All tools icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/workspace-all-tools-button.svg)**All tools** to see a list of workspace tools.
2. Select ![objects icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/object-storage-monoochrome-icon.svg)**Object Storage**.

From the **Search bar**:

1. Select the ![magnifying glass icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/workspace-search-icon.svg) magnifying glass at the top to open the search tool.
2. Type “Object Storage” to locate the tool and select it from the results.

To associate a new object store with your Replit App, create a bucket.

How to create a bucket

From the **Object Storage** tool:

1. Click on **Create new bucket**.
2. Enter a name for the bucket in the **Name** field and select **Create bucket**.

The Object Storage tab should resemble the following screenshot:

![screenshot of the Object Storage tool](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/object-storage-empty-bucket.png)

To create additional buckets, open the bucket dropdown menu on the top left of the **Object Storage** tab and select **Create new bucket**.

The following sections explain the bucket and object management options in the Object Storage tool.

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#select-a-bucket)  Select a bucket

To switch between your storage buckets, select the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the **Object Storage** tab.

The selected bucket displays a checkmark next to its name, as shown in the screenshot below:

![screenshot of bucket selection menu](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/select-bucket.png)

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#access-the-bucket-id)  Access the Bucket ID

To view the **Bucket ID** by selecting the **Settings** view from the dropdown at the top of the **Object Storage** tab.
The Bucket ID uniquely identifies the bucket, which your code must reference to perform an operation.

If you have multiple buckets, select the correct one from the dropdown menu in the top left corner.

The following screenshot shows the Bucket ID for the “FileVault Bucket 1” bucket:

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#upload-or-download-objects)  Upload or download objects

To upload an object to the selected bucket:

1. Navigate to the **Objects** view in the **Object Storage** tab.
2. Select ![upload file icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/upload-file.svg)**Upload files**, or ![upload folder icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/upload-folder.svg)**Upload folder** to upload all files from a folder.
Then, select one or more files to upload from the file dialog.
Alternatively, drag a file or folder into the area that lists the contents of the bucket.

To download an object from the selected bucket:

1. Navigate to the **Objects** view in the **Object Storage** tab.
2. Select the ![download icon](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/download-icon.svg) download icon to the right of the file to download it.

### [​](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage\#organize-objects-in-folders)  Organize objects in folders

To create a folder in the selected bucket:

1. Navigate to the **Objects** view in the **Object Storage** tab.

3. Enter a name for the folder.

To add objects to a folder in the **Objects** view, drag an object to the destination folder.

To move the object to a parent folder, drag it to the above the header to the name of the folder above the object list.
The following animation shows moving the “product\_demo.mov” file from the “videos” folder to the parent “Objects” folder:

Replit connects all buckets you create to your account and makes them available to
all your Replit Apps. The Replit App from which you create the bucket automatically
receives access.

You can control which of your Replit Apps have access to a specific bucket, which lets you
share data efficiently and securely.
